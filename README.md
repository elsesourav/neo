 ## `Overview`
 > '**Neo**' is an advanced chatbot built using web technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It integrates with the Gemini API and utilizes the Showdown.js and Highlight.js libraries. The chatbot is designed to provide a rich user experience with features such as audio chat, colorful code highlighting, and various user interface enhancements.

## `Features`
> - **Audio Chat:** Allows users to communicate with the chatbot using voice input and output.
> - **Colorful Code Highlighting:** Utilizes Highlight.js to display code snippets with syntax highlighting for better readability.
